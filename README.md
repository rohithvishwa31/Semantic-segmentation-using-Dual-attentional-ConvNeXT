# Semantic-segmentation-using-Dual-attentional-ConvNeXT
Project Description
This project focuses on semantic segmentation of road scenes as part of an Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS). The model combines a ConvNeXt backbone with Dual Attention mechanisms—Channel Attention and Spatial Attention—followed by a fusion strategy to enhance pixel-wise segmentation performance.

The goal is to segment various elements of a road scene such as roads, vehicles, pedestrians, vegetation, and buildings to improve scene understanding in autonomous driving systems.
